# Credit_Risk_Analysis


By using the latest machine learning techniques, these FinTech firms can continuously analyze large amounts of data and predict trends to optimize lending.

In this module, you'll use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.


What You Will Learn
By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

Explain how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics.
Create training and test groups from a given data set.
Implement the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
Interpret the results of the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm.
Determine which supervised learning algorithm is best used for a given data set or scenario.
Use ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance.
